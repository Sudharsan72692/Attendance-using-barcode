# Attendance-using-barcode
I developed a program which is used to make attendance through scanning the barcode and store the scanned barcode information in an excel sheet. If the excel sheet doesn't exist it automatically create a file. If the file already exist the data will be stored in the excel sheet.
You can run the code by following the below conditions.
cv2 (OpenCV): OpenCV is used for capturing frames from the camera and displaying the frames. You can install it using pip:
pip install opencv-python
pyzbar: This library is used for decoding barcodes. You can install it using pip:
pip install pyzbar
openpyxl: This library is used for working with Excel files. You can install it using pip:
pip install openpyxl
winsound: This module is used for playing a beep sound. It is a built-in module in Python, so no additional installation is required.
os: This module is also a built-in module in Python, so no additional installation is required.
These are teh required modules to run the code.
